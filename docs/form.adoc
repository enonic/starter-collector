In this section we'll cover the basics of how to create the collector forms.


== Introduction

Collectors can be configured on a per collection basis - using forms. The forms are built with React components.

In theory, any react component type should be supported.

== Basics

The component receives four props from Explorer:

. collectorConfig - Config state object.
. setCollectorConfig - A function to modify the config state object.
. setCollectorConfigErrorCount - A function to set how many validation errors the form has.
. ref - A reference which makes it possible for the parent (Explorer Admin) to call functions inside this child component.






== collectorConfig

This is a standard React.useState object. You can write any nested configuration properties you need to it (using the setCollectorConfig function). When the form is successfully submitted, the state object is persisted. Which means the next time the form is opened, the previous state is available.

== setCollectorConfig

This is a standard setState function returned by React.useState. Use it to change the state of the collectorConfig object.

== setCollectorConfigErrorCount

This is a standard setState function returned by React.useState. Use it to allow or prevent form submission. 0 errors are required to allow form submission.

== ref

The react component can pass two named function references to it's parent component (Explorer Admin).

=== afterReset

In Explorer Admin there is a [Reset] form button. If you need any code to run in your component when this button is clicked pass a function named "afterReset" to the parent via React.useImperativeHandle:

[source,typescript]
----
React.useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    afterReset
}));
----

=== validate

Each time the form state changes, the form is validated. If you need any code to run in your component during validation then pass a function named "validate" to the parent via React.useImperativeHandle:

[source,typescript]
----
React.useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    validate
}));
----
