In this chapter you will create, buid, deploy and run a collector based on a template.

== Introduction

Collectors are implemented as standard Enonic applications. This chapter will guide you through the basic steps of building your own custom collector.

NOTE: The following steps will require https://developer.enonic.com/start[Enonic CLI] to be installed

== Create a sandbox


A sandbox is a local developer instance of our platform - Enonic XP. 

. Create a sandbox called `mycollector` by running this command in your terminal:

  enonic sandbox create mycollector

. Choose the latest version of Enonic XP (default).
. Start the sandbox with this command:

  enonic sandbox start --dev mycollector

TIP: Dev mode is used to automatically load changes in your code when developing.


== Create the app

From a **new terminal window**, run the following command to create the application.

  enonic project create -r starter-collector

IMPORTANT: Choose the sandbox created in the previous step (if you have multiple sandboxes).

[TIP]
====
This command uses the https://github.com/enonic/starter-collector[Collector starter^] Github repo  as a starter (template) for the app.
====


== Build & deploy

From the app folder you created (i.e. `myproject/`), run this command:

  enonic project deploy

The application should now compile, and deploy to the sandbox.

== Trying it out

Open a web broswer and access the Enonic XP Dashboard at http://localhost:8080

Click btn:[LOG IN AS GUEST], this will sign you in with super user pemissions.

=== Install Explorer

Next up, in order to use the collector you also need to install the Explorer application.

Open `XP menu` -> `Applications` and click btn:[Install].

Find Explorer in the list and click the btn:[Install] button.

With Explorer installed, you can open the Explorer admin from the XP menu: `XP menu` -> `Explorer`

=== Document type

Document types are used to control indexing of content, and collectors may automatially provide document types. These are called "managed document types". 

Back in Explorer, click the hamburger menu and select btn:[Document types].

You should now find a document type called `starter_doctype`, to see the detais - select it and click the btn:[Edit] button.

As this is a manage type, you will have to ignore the warning. As long as you don't make any changes this is perfectly safe.

Whenever a new verion of the collector app is deployed, the manage document types will be updated to the new version.


=== Create collection

To try out the new collector, click the hamburger menu and select btn:[Collections].

Click the green bottom-right Create collection btn:[+] button. Fill in a name and select a Default language for the collection. For instance en-US.

Select the `Sample collector` in the collector dropdown.

After selecting the collector, a simple form will appear. This form was bundled with your collector and can be customized to your needs. As you will see laster.

Fill in the URL field with this value: `https://example.com`

Save the new collection.

=== Collect

Its time to give the collector a spin. From the collections list, simply click the btn:[green cloud download] icon.

This will start running the task from inside the collector app, using the url you filled in above. It should complete within seconds, and the document count should increase to `1`.

NOTE: If you don't see any changes, try refreshing, check the sandbox logs, or visit the `Journal` menu items - located just below `Collections` in the menu.


Now that you have a collection with a document, you may search for it from the btn:[Documents] page.

To limit the search to only documents from a single collection, open the Collections page and click the btn:[number] in the Documents column. This will open the Documents page with a filter for that collection.

Fill in a search term in the search input. For instance "example" and hit kbd:[Enter].

You should now get a search result with the document and the word you searched for highlighted.

If you search for a word that isn't in the document, the search result should be empty.


== Development

Now that you have familiarized yourself with the Explorer app, it's time to start developing your own collector.

Continue to <<Development>>.


. They essentially consist of two main components:

Form:: A React based user interface that enable search administrators to instruct the collector in itâ€™s specific activities.

Task:: Code that performs the actual retrieval of content for indexing.
